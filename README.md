## About project

This bot was created for a small real estate agency, to boost their productivity and do some routine work much faster.

## What can it do

First of all it can get all the images from advertisements pages on sites dom.ria and olx 
To get all items from 1 advertisment just paste-in url of it directly to the bot
Then bot will send all needed images directly to you as files. Simple as that
Secondly, he can send needed documents just by sending him right command
Thirdly, he can send basic descripiton text for new objects, that are usually used in new posts and advertisements
And if you dont want pre-built descriptions, bot will give you url to 'descripiton-constructor', where you can make your own, more specific and more suited for your needs.
'Description constructor' on his own are avaliable [here](https://github.com/kazapanama/realty-constructor)
